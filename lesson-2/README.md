### HTML & CSS
* HTML: Gives your page structure
* CSS: Makes your page pretty

### CSS
* CSS = Cascading Style Sheets
* CSS is a "style sheet language" that lets you style the elements on your page

#### What can it do?
* format
* color
* size 
* positioning

#### Style Rules
CSS is a list of "style rules". Each style rule consists of a "selector" and "declarations" of property-value

pairs:

    selector {
        property: value;
        property: value;
    }

    body {
        color: yellow;
        background-color: black;
    }
