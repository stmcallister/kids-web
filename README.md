# Kids Web
These are lessons that I tought to a group of bright third graders. Since the students were all using Chromebooks that didn't allow them to install any additional software, we used the [Plunker](https://plnkr.co/) editor to experiment with each of the HTML and CSS concepts that we discussed.

When we got into JavaScript we used [jsconsole](https://jsconsole.com/).

* **lesson-1** -- [intro to html](lesson-1/README.md)
* **lesson-2** -- [intro to css](lesson-2/README.md)
* **lesson-3** -- [intro to js](lesson-3/README.md)
* **lesson-4** -- [basic data types and variables](lesson-4/README.md)
