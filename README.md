These are lessons that I tought to a group of bright Third Graders. Since the students were all using Chromebooks that didn't allow them to install any additional software, we used [Plunker](https://plnkr.co/) Editor to experiment with each of the concepts that we discussed.

* **lesson-1** -- [intro to html](lesson-1/README.md)
* **lesson-2** -- [intro to css](lesson-2/README.md)
* **lesson-3** -- [intro to js](lesson-3/README.md)
* **lesson-4** -- [basic data types and variables](lesson-4/README.md)
