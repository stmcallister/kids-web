## Lesson 1: Intro to HTML
Objectives:
* Introduce concepts of what the Internet is -- a collection of connected computers that are networked together
* Everything on the network has an address that tells us where to find it
* Web pages -- special files on those computers that contain permissions for you to view them
* Basic HTML
    * `<head>` -- where the doctype, title and things that "do" (javascript and css references) live.
    * `<body>` -- tells what the page looks like. gives it structure
    * `<p>` -- makes groups called "paragraphs"
    * `<img>` -- reiterate the address concept
    * `<a href>` -- another address example
    * `style` attribute ( didn't have time to really over this )
